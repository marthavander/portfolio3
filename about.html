          <h2 class="teal space-top1">About Me</h2>
          <p class="about-text">I started college wanting to be a biomedical engineer.
            After a D in chemistry (WITH a tutor) and an A in drawing, I changed my
            major to graphic design and I’ve been a designer ever since. I have no
            doubt I picked the right profession – I love solving problems! While my
            career started with print, I’ve always had an interest in technology. One
            summer, when projects were at a lull, I started learning html and began
            coding emails. A few years later, there was a reorganization in my
            department and I was moved to the UX team. I didn’t even know what
            UX was at the time, but I learned what I could and knew I wanted to
            know more. Unfortunately, a few years later, the company was having
            many rounds of layoffs so I was let go after 20 years. That’s ok because
            the severance allowed me to learn more about UX and take my career to
            the next level.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text-bottom">I have the belief that people can understand
            complicated ideas if those ideas are presented in simple ways. I’m
            excited to help users have experiences they can easily understand.
