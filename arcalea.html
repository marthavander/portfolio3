        <h3 class="cs-head1">Summary</h3>
        <p class="cs-text">The client approached me with a request for a new website for his digital
          marketing company. His current site was very old, copy heavy and would break when not viewed
          on a desktop, so we were starting at square one. I provided the visual design and photo
          research for his new site. I also brought in a writer to help with the copy.
        </p>
        <a class="cs-button" target=”_blank” href="https://arcalea.com">VIEW SITE</a>
        <h3 class="cs-head1">Problem</h3>
        <p class="cs-text">The client needed a completely new website for his digital marketing
          company. None of the visual design from his previous site was usable as it had many issues.
          It was a top to bottom overhaul.
        </p>
        <h3 class="cs-head">Solution</h3>
        <p class="cs-text space-bottom1">I worked closely with the client to determine his goals. I p
          rovided a moodboard, wireframes, photos and high resolution visual designs for desktop and
          mobile. I also provided a stylesheet for the developers.

        <h3 class="cs-head">Moodboard + Competitor Reviews</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left">The client provided a thorough competitive analysis. I reviewed the
          competitors’ sites to help develop a moodboard which I reviewed with the client.

        <h3 class="cs-head">Rough Sketches</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left">After reviewing the moodboard with the client, I began rough sketches.
          Rough sketches speeds up the ideation process which ultimately saves time by getting to
          better ideas faster.

      <div class="cs-category">
        <h3 class="cs-head">Wireframes</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left">When I felt that I had several strong rough ideas I put them into
          wireframes. We started with the homepage first. I presented my first set of wireframes
          to the client. We had a couple of rounds of edits before moving onto the visual designs.

      <div class="cs-category">
        <h3 class="cs-head">Visual Designs</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left">Since we spent some time determining the structure of the wireframes,
          the visual design went quickly. I presented two designs based on the wireframes. The client
          chose one of the directions. I made the final tweaks and then moved onto the rest of the
          pages.

        <h3 class="cs-head">Writer</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left">As I began more detailed work on the pages, my client still didn’t
          have a writer for the new site, which he needed badly. I introduced him to a former co-worker
          and we were off and running.
        </p>

        <h3 class="cs-head">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright space-bottom1">This was a fantastic opportunity that came to me
          as I was considering new projects for my portfolio. My client was very hands on which can sometimes
          be a problem for designers. But, that was not a problem for me. He provided wonderful feedback and
          always listened to my thoughts and the reasoning for my decisions. I really enjoyed working on this
          project.
