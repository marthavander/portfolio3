        <h3 class="cs-head1">Summary</h3>
        <p class="cs-text">The client approached me with a request for a cloud storage product.
              They felt the market had room for another player, provided the right features combined
              to meet the needs of a specific audience. From my research, there was definitely a
              market for a medical information storage app. I provided research, design and testing
              for the project.

        <h3 class="cs-head1">Problem</h3>
        <p class="cs-text">The client wanted a unique solution for a cloud storage project.
              My research showed me a healthcare information storage app would be a good solution.
              There are few apps in the marketplace that store and organize your complete medical
              information. The iPhone has a health app that is pretty detailed. I felt I could
              do a better job organizing the information to make an app that was simpler and
              easier to use.
        </p>
        <h3 class="cs-head">Solution</h3>
        <p class="cs-text space-bottom1">Apple’s health app is has a lot of details but it doesn’t have clear
              organization and category names. It’s also only available for one user. I created a
              solution that would work for many users. It allows organizing and sharing of medical
              information, provides medication reminders and permits emergency responders to view
              medications and allergies.

      <h2 class="cs-section-head">User Research</h2>
      <h3 class="cs-head">User Survey</h3>
      <p class="cs-text-left">My research showed more iOS users than Android so the app was built for iOS.
        I also discovered many people have health related apps on their phones, mostly to track exercise.
        Folks are good about going to the doctor, many visit several. Many people take medication for
        one reason or another, which is unfortunate because half of the survey respondents were under 30!
        I found almost all surveyed would like all their medical information in one place. Some features
        respondents wanted are exercise, body measurements, medications, medication reminders, doctor
        contact information, appointments and lab tests.
      </p>
      <p class="callout-1">93&percnt; of people surveyed would like all of their medical information to be in one place.
      </p>
      <h3 class="cs-head">Personas</h3>

      <p class="cs-persona-text"><strong>Lily McCormick</strong> is a 20-year old college student studying marketing.
        She ran track and cross country in high school and has continued running in college. Lately,
        her asthma seems to be acting up and her running times are getting slower. She knows she needs
        to visit her doctor to get refills for her medications and talk tell him what’s been going on.
        She gets busy with school and friends and forgets to schedule the appointments.
      </p>
      <img class="cs-persona-pic" src="images/jeremy.png" alt="Persona Jeremy Owens" height="119" width="118" />
      <p class="cs-persona-text"><strong>Jeremy Owens</strong> got a college scholarship to Columbia University.
        He wants to be a doctor to help kids who have severe allergies like he did. Growing up Jeremy had a severe
        peanut allergy. He ended up in the emergency room several times because he couldn’t breathe. He’s outgrown
        his peanut allergy some but he still carries his medication with him in case something happens. He loves
        kids and would like to be a pediatric allergist one day. He understands he has to watch his own health to
        make sure he doesn’t end up in the emergency room. He’s too busy focusing on his studies to be sick!

      <p class="cs-persona-text-spacebottom"><strong>Elaine Nelson</strong> is a graphic designer who works in downtown Omaha. She’s
        married and has 2 children who are still living at home. Her children are in many activities and she helps care
        for her elderly mother. Elaine has an underactive thyroid and high blood pressure for which she takes medications.
        She visits about 3 doctors a year for her own conditions. She also attends her mother’s doctor’s visits when she can.
        Elaine gets her mother’s medications from the pharmacy and helps her mother keep track of her medications. She
        juggles a lot and sometimes feels like she’s forgetting something.

      <h3 class="cs-head">Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">I analyzed three competitors – Capzule, Andaman7 and the iOS Health app. These three apps
        have similarities like name, age, medications, allergies and emergency contacts. Yet, none of them left me with a
        positive user experience. I found each of them frustrating to navigate.
      </p>
      <div class="competitors">
        <p class="cs-text-left">I’ve been an iPhone user for many years and never knew about the health app or its medical
        ID feature until a nurse showed it to me recently. Apple doesn’t do a good job of educating users about it. This
        can be good in that it’s only password protection is the touch ID or passcode, but bad because if users don’t
        know about it, they can’t use it. It’s well hidden and unemphasized. The simplicity of it is good because
        emergency personnel are likely familiar with it. They can quickly access a user’s medications, allergies and
        other critical information in emergency situations.

      </div>
        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">The user flow process for Andaman7 and Capzule were significantly more lengthy and
        confusing than Apple’s Medical ID. Onboarding, categorizing and saving were all lengthy for Andaman7 and
        Capzule. Apple’s editing feature was jumpy, the app kept moving to the top of the page when adding data.
        It also is significantly smaller than the other two apps and has much less capacity to hold data. There
        is definitely room for an improved health record storage app in the marketplace in addition to patient
        portals which are normally only edited by doctors and healthcare professionals. This kind of app would
        allow a patient to store all of their medical information in one place.

      <h3 class="cs-head1">Wire Frames + User Testing</h3>
      <p class="cs-prebullet-text">I learned a lot from user testing my wireframes. I asked users to:</p>
      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li class="cs-text-list">sign up for the app</li>
        <li class="cs-text-list">add a new note</li>
        <li class="cs-text-list">record a new medication you just started taking</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">Users didn’t see the words Medications + Allergies under the Medical ID
        title. Some of them went to Patient Portal. So I changed that language. I learned the app
        needed a stronger identity and promoted more in the marketing landing page. I needed to
        determine the best way to add and edit content. One user couldn’t tell the categories were
        clickable so I addressed that in my visual designs and preference tested it.

        I struggled with the name and logo a little. At first, everything I tried seemed
        trite. I couldn’t decide if this app was going to be called Healthplus or Healthlog.
        I felt Healthlog was a more accurate description of the app but I didn’t feel any
        of my logos were strong representations for it. Then I recalled a logo I’d worked
        on for a previous project that was never used. I really liked this logo and felt
        with a couple tweaks, it would be a fantastic solution.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">
        I played with different fonts. Ultimately, I felt raleway was the best solution.
        It evoked a positive, simple feeling which is what I wanted my app to be. Medical
        problems aren’t positive. This app needed to counter that in any way that it could.

        Pulling from a previous healthcare project, I had purple and teal in mind as colors.
        They needed to be bright and positive without appearing inappropriate. While researching
        images for my moodboard, I discovered a layout that I could incorporate into my app.
        It gave me the idea to assign different colors to different users. So, I chose two
        more colors that would complement the purple and teal. I suggested the palette below
        but then gave users the option to choose their own color choice for their profile.

      <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">In order to help the logo stand out, I chose a different
        font from Raleway for the app, landing page and any other collateral. I chose Roboto
        because it paired well with Raleway and had many different styles which would help
        contribute to the hierarchy of the app.

      <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright space-bottom1">Armed with colors, fonts and layout ideas, I moved onto mockups.
        I carried each user’s color choice through their part of the app. It was at this stage I decided
        to add two more colors for any links and the medications + allergies section which could be
        enabled to be seen by emergency personnel. I added profile pictures and determined when to use
        icons and when to use text for links and editing. As the corners of shapes were rounded, I went
        with rounded buttons to be consistent. I felt the rounded curves throughout the design created
        a softness that would contribute to the positive feeling I wanted to evoke.</p>

      <h2 class="cs-section-head space-top2">Final User Testing</h2>
      <h3 class="cs-head">The Last Test</h3>
      <p class="cs-prebullet-text">I ran three final tests asking users to:</p>
      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li class="cs-text-list">walk through the process of logging in</li>
        <li class="cs-text-list">email their complete record to their doctor</li>
        <li class="cs-text-list">add a note</li>
        <li class="cs-text-list">edit a user profile</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">Everything went as intended. One user wasn’t sure if the share
        action would send the record to the doctor. Another one suggested I take a closer look at color
        contrast. Since the other testers were quick to go to the share button to send the record, I
        didn’t make any changes. I did, however, update colors to pass AA accessibility for not just
        larger sized text but normal sized text as well.
      </p>
      <h3 class="cs-head">Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">The most important thing I learned is the importance of testing.
        I’ve been a designer for a long time and I had some strong feelings. But that’s not what this
        process is about. It isn’t about which design I prefer, it’s which one the user prefers and why
        they prefer it. I can make assumptions all day but unless those assumptions are tested and proven,
        they’re not valid. I was so sure my first dashboard design was it. Visually, I felt great about it.
        But the testers preferred a more concise view. It wasn’t all for not, however. I was able to use
        that layout elsewhere in the app.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">If I’d had more time, I would have liked to work more on the
        animation. I did some research but couldn’t quite find a quick way to accomplish it. It would
        require more time than I could give unfortunately. I did, however, communicate to the developer
        the interactions I would like to see.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright space-bottom2">In future projects, I’m definitely going to take
        advantage of the preference test. It’s super fast, you don’t need a script, it’s free and you can
        do it on your phone! It’s just too simple not to do it – and it can bring important changes to your
        project.
