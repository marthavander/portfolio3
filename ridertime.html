        <h3 class="cs-head1">Summary</h3>
        <p class="cs-text">RiderTime is a Transit app. Public transportation officials in Chicago have
          added many bus routes. This has resulted in several different routes coming to the same stop.
          Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the
          bus stop. The solution that I felt would be effective was a stop information screen. Riders
          select the stop information button which takes them to a screen where they enter the stop
          information. They click get results to go to the next screen which lists the bus routes and
          how often they came to that stop.
        </p>

        <h3 class="cs-head1">Problem</h3>
        <p class="cs-text">Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they
          have to get to the bus stop. Rushing to the stop because you see a bus coming is frustrating
          when it’s not the bus the rider wanted. Riders are complaining the most about the bus stop
          at Washington and State, which has seven bus lines serving it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="cs-head">Solution</h3>
        <p class="cs-text space-bottom1">I started with a screen that offered the rider a choice of
          getting directions, stop information or line information as well as previous searches.
          When the rider clicks stop information, they are taken to a new screen that requests
          information about the stop. When the rider clicks get results, the list of routes and
          how often they run appears. Screens 1 and 3 also have a map that identifies the rider’s
          location.

      <h2 class="cs-section-head">User Research</h2>
      <div class="cs-category">
        <h3 class="cs-head">User Survey</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left">Over 80% of survey respondents use public transportation to get around
          their own city or a city they are visiting. Most people take a bus, subway or commuter train.
          The biggest reason respondents use public transportation is to get around cities they visit.
          That is closely followed by people using it to commute to and from work. The frequency of
          taking public transportation is split fairly evenly between all the time, seldom and every
          so often. That makes me think you’re a regular user or don’t use it much at all.
        </p>
        <p class="callout-1">This survey got responses from all age groups. I feel apps are a great
          way to utilize public transportation.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-text-left">Over half of the respondents use an app to track their public
          transportation. All the app users agree it helps them get to where they need to go. A third
          of these respondents use Google Maps. Moovit, Citymapper, DC Metro, New York Subway and DB
          App are other apps that are used. All the app users are satisfied with the app they use and
          over 80% feel the app had all the features that they needed to get to their destination. The
          most used feature is a mobile alert that says that the bus/train is a specific number of
          minutes away from the stop. Two other features used often are accurate, real time tracking of
          arrivals/departures and route information. Most people were not able to pay the fare through
          their app.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="cs-category">
        <h3 class="cs-head">Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <div class="competitors">
          <p class="cs-text-left">I conducted a SWOT analysis with Transit and Google Maps. Transit’s
             multimodal feature is interesting. It understands commuters are in a hurry and sometimes
             buses and trains are late or not even coming at all. So it offers different options to get
             where you need to go. Google has multiple apps that relate to each other, like their search
             function and their map app. Not only will they tell you where your closest Starbucks is but
             they will tell you how to get there. I must say, I feel the visual design on their Maps app
             could be simplified somehow. It has a lot going on and it’s a little overwhelming to view.
             Aside from that, it’s a strong app. Google may just take over the world one day. But in the
             meantime, there are a few companies that will not go down without a fight.

          would give them these suggestions:</p>

        most priority:</p>
        <ol class="cs-list">
          <li class="cs-text-list">As a user, I want to search for the best route to go to a destination so

        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">Google Maps and Transit displayed how much time it took to walk
          to a bus stop, when the next bus was leaving and when a bus was leaving several hours later. They
          both did a good job showing that, although Google Maps did not have a special alert for it unless
          you made one within settings. What struck me was that they did not have information about what
          the next bus was to approach a stop. And what was the best way to convey that? The solution that
          I felt would be effective was a stop info button. It would be separate from an alerts button.
          Once selected, the stop info button would allow the app to list the next busses arriving and their
          expected times as well as any other important information.

        <h3 class="cs-head">Gathering Feedback</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">Steve Krug, a noted UX author, created a standard user testing
          script that I modified for RiderTime. Since I was using paper prototypes, I did my tests in person.
          For the first task, I asked the user to walk through the process of finding out how much time they
          needed to get from their office near the bus stop at Washington and State to go home. For the
          second task, I asked them to walk through the process to see what the next arriving bus was at
          the Washington and State stop.</p>
        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">I chose 3 user testers who were regular public transit riders
          and who used apps to help them get to their destinations. All three located the stop information
          button on the first screen and agreed that’s where they would click to determine what the next
          buses were to arrive at their stop and how long it would be before their bus got to the stop.
          They understood they needed to enter the name of the bus or train stop in the next screen.</p>
        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">On the third screen, one tester suggested I remove the number
            sign in front of the bus line number as it wasn’t really necessary. Another tester questioned
            the small type under the destination since I had type indicated but not specified. I took note
            of their observations and thought about how I might apply them to the next phase of the project,
            a high fidelity visual design.

        <h3 class="cs-head">Providing Clarity and Understanding</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">Having a map on the screen tells us exactly which Washington and
          State bus stop is being used, which is the northbound one. A list populates the screen that tells
          what bus is approaching the stop and how often it comes. I chose a bright blue because it’s one
          of Chicago Transit Association’s colors and it’s seen a lot on the buses. The sans serif font
          allows for clear readability. The bus numbers and minutes away are large and bold for quick and
          easy recognition. The client did have content to use for the smaller type and it was approved to
          move to development. This is a great way for riders to know when their bus is coming with a quick,
          easy read.

        <h3 class="cs-head">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">Public transportation riders are in a hurry. In large cities,
          like Chicago, they might have long commutes. They don’t want to waste their time waiting for the
          next bus or train. And they don’t want to rush to a bus stop only to find that the bus they were
          chasing wasn’t theirs. It’s important to understand the riders’ perspectives, what their pain
          points are and have the ability to empathize with them.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-text-left-spaceright">It would have been easy to redesign an entire app, but that’s not
          what the client was requesting. It would’ve been easy to generate the perfect app with lots of
          great features. But that would have been very out of scope. It’s important to understand the
          specific problem to solve in a product so time and money isn’t wasted.
